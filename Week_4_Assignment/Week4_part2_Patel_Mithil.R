# Created a table of sale price column from the dataframe

# Use the apply function on a variable in your dataset
# Calculated mean sale price using apply() function
mean_price <- apply(X= sale_price, MARGIN= 2, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)

# Use the aggregate function on a variable in your dataset
# Calculated mean sale price by 'current_zone' column using aggregate() function
mean_byZone <- aggregate(df$`Sale Price` ~ current_zoning, df, mean)

# Use the plyr function on a variable in your dataset â€“ more specifically, I want 
# to see you split some data, perform a modification to the data, and then bring it back together

# Split data by houses with only 4 bedrooms
data_four_bedrooms <- filter(df, bedrooms == 4)

# Adding a column to the original dataframe which calculates dollar price per square feet

# Calculating the average sale price by bedrooms and building_grade

# Check distributions of the data
# Constructing a histogram using "ggplot2" to check for distribution 
library(ggplot2)

# Based on the histogram, the distribution is right skewed, not normal. Consideration the large
# dataset, visual analysis is a viable option than quantitative analysis using stats.desc() function
# to conclude data distribution.

# Identify if there are any outliers
# Constructing a boxplot to detect outliers
ggplot(df, aes(y = `Sale Price`)) + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip()

# Yes, there exist outliers in our data, which may have resulted in skewed distribution.
# To calculate the number of outliers, we can use quantile(), IQR(), and sum() function
left_bound = sum(df$`Sale Price` < quantile(df$`Sale Price`, p= 0.25)-1.5 * IQR(df$`Sale Price`))
right_bound = sum(df$`Sale Price` > quantile(df$`Sale Price`, p= 0.75)+1.5 * IQR(df$`Sale Price`))
print(left_bound + right_bound)

# Total number of outliers: 633
